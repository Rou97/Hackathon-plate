## Process

### Ideation

Postopia is a company which offers small businesses a fast, cheap and secure delivery option to their customers.

The delivery is taken in charge by our float of automated zeppelins.
It embarks high technologies to take your packages to their destination in the most efficient way.

Like Lyft, an algorithm is in charge of finding the closest and most adequate zeppelin for your delivery. Through our app, find a zeppelin and book it. Indicate the package destination, our zeppelin will fly to you, drop the parcel in the compartment area. Once ready, the zeppelin will fly and deliver your package
to its destination.

### Research
Our main competitors are car sharing companies or other deliverers like Stuart or Glovo.
We took inspiration in top car sharing companies like Moia or Lyft for our landing page.
They convey an image of tech and reliability.

### Storytelling
